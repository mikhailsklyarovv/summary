About me:

    I consider my passion for programming to be my main advantage.
    I've been interested in this topic when I was 16, and I'm not going to stop under any circumstances.
    The direction of study at the Institute was chosen in the same way - not by chance.
    I believe that the combination of programming with any sphere of life, rather than
    considering them separately, gives more potential and opportunities for growth,
    both career and personal. I welcome a healthy lifestyle, do combat Sambo and go to the gym.
